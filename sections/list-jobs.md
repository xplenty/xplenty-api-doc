## List Jobs

### Description

    * **failed** - the job failed to complete
    * **pending_stoppage** - the user sent a request to stop the job
    * **stopping** - the job is stopping
    * **stopped** - the job has stopped
* **variables** - a list of the variables supplied to the "run" request
* **owner_id** - the numeric user ID
* **progress** - the job progress in percentages (a value between 0.0 and 1.0)
* **outputs_count** - the number of output targets defined in the job's package
* **outputs** - list of the output targets defined in the job's package
* **started_at** - the date and time the job started running
* **created_at** - the date and time the "run" request was made
* **failed_at** - the date and time the job failed (if it failed)
* **updated_at** - the date and time the job was last updated (occurs when package tasks are completed)
* **cluster_id** - the ID of the cluster in which the job was run
* **package_id** - the ID of the package that the job ran (or is running)
* **errors** - a textual message describing errors encountered while the job was run
* **url** - the job resource URL
* **runtime_in_seconds** - the time in seconds that the job has run up to the current time
* **completed_at** - the date and time at which the job completed (stopped, failed or completed)
