## Run Job

### Description
This call creates a new job and triggers it to run. The job performs the series of data processing tasks that are defined in the job's package. Unless the job encounters an error or is terminated by the user, it will run until it completes its tasks on all of the input data.

A successful call returns the following details for the job:

* **id** - the numeric job ID
* **status** - the job status. Possible values are: 
    * **idle** - the user sent a request to run the job
    * **pending** - the job is initializing
    * **running** - the job is running
    * **completed** - the job completed successfully
    * **failed** - the job failed to complete
    * **pending_stoppage** - the user sent a request to stop the job
    * **stopping** - the job is stopping
    * **stopped** - the job has stopped
* **variables** - a list of the variables supplied to the "run" request
* **owner_id** - the numeric user ID
* **progress** - the job progress in percentages (a value between 0.0 and 1.0)
* **outputs_count** - the number of output targets defined in the job's package
* **outputs** - list of the output targets defined in the job's package
* **started_at** - the date and time the job started running
* **created_at** - the date and time the "run" request was made 
* **failed_at** - the date and time the job failed (if it failed)
* **updated_at** - the date and time the job was last updated (occurs when package tasks are completed)
* **cluster_id** - the ID of the cluster in which the job was run
* **package_id** - the ID of the package that the job ran (or is running)
* **errors** - a textual message describing errors encountered while the job was run
* **url** - the job resource URL
* **runtime_in_seconds** - the time in seconds that the job has run up to the current time
* **completed_at** - the date and time at which the job completed (stopped, failed or completed)

### Notes
* You must save the job ID value returned in the response "id" field. You will use the value to refer to this job in subsequent API calls.
